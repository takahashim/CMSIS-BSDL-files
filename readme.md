# CMSIS files (BSD licence parts)

## About these files

From 'END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT FOR THE CORTEX MICROCONTROLLER SOFTWARE INTERFACE STANDARD (CMSIS) DELIVERABLES':

```
Separate Files

The package also includes the components contained in the following directories:

(a) ./CMSIS/DSP_Lib - DSP Library sources and examples;
(b) ./CMSIS/Include - Header files;
(c) ./CMSIS/Lib - DSP Library build for various toolchains;
(d) ./CMSIS/RTOS - Header file template for CMSIS-RTOS implementation; and
(e) ./Device - Template files and implementations for Cortex-M class processors.

All of the above components are licensed to you under the terms of the BSD licence,
which is incorporated within or alongside the above components.
```

So I repackage files in above directories.
